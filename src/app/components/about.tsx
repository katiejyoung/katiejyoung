            I&apos;m a full-stack engineer who genuinely enjoys taking on
            challenges. Whether it&apos;s architecting a complex web application
            with modern tools like Next.js, React, and TypeScript, or the
            hands-on experience of building a tiny house, I&apos;m driven by the
            process of creation and problem-solving. My four years in
            fully-remote teams have honed my ability to collaborate effectively
            and deliver results independently.

            I&apos;m also an avid outdoors enthusiast, always up for camping,
            hiking, or kayaking â€“ and I&apos;m really looking forward to
            experiencing Puerto Rico for the first time this year. I live in
            Richmond, VA with my two cats, Ping and April. I have a soft spot
            for all things Halloween and for cheering on the Washington Spirit!
